In this project, I will be using a transactional dataset that encompasses all transactions from a UK-based online retail company, 
spanning from 01/12/2010 to 09/12/2011. This company specializes in selling unique all-occasion gifts and has many wholesale customers. 
To better understand and serve these customers, I will utilize Customer Segmentation using the RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) model. 
This method will help me categorize customers based on how recently they made a purchase (Recency), how often they make purchases (Frequency), 
and their total spending (Monetary). By analyzing these dimensions, I can segment customers into various groups like loyal customers, big 
spenders, or at-risk customers. This segmentation will not only help me comprehend the value of different customer groups but also aid in 
predicting future behaviors and crafting targeted marketing strategies to boost customer retention and maximize revenue.
